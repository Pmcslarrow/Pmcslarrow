# Welcome

Welcome to my Github! Please feel free to search through some of my public repos that I have enjoyed creating over the years. 

You will see four projects that are pinned. These are some of my favorite projects I have worked on:
1. hoop-easy-material-ui is a full stack react app that aims to help people find and create pickup basketball games. It is my most complete application and is hosted at hoopeasy.org. It is also the newest version of hoop easy that remodeled the UI and logic used to drive efficiency in the memory usage. The README file has lots of information on what changed from the old version of hoop easy and why it is actually better now than before. 
2. frozen_lake_reinforcement_learning is a newer project that I really enjoyed completing as I got to learn a lot more about RL in the process. A purely educational project but there is a lot of fascinating details in the repo.
3. hoop-easy is similar to hoop-easy-material-ui but it is the original version of hoop-easy. I kept both the new version and the old one so that someone would be able to see what has changed both in UI development as well as changes to the overall logic. Hoop Easy was my largest project to this date, and it took a lot of time and creativity to re-create it nearly from scratch.
4. pmcslarrow@github.io is just my personal portfolio, but thought it best to be pinned.
