# Welcome

Welcome to my Github! Please feel free to search through some of my public repos that I have enjoyed creating over the years. 

I am currently completing my M.S. in Computer Science at Northwestern University, specializing in AI/ML. The projects listed below represent just a few of the many I have worked on. I hope to combine my full-stack development knowledge from my undergraduate degree at Willamette University with my focused AI/ML studies at Northwestern to develop products and services that improve people's lives.

You will see a few projects that are pinned. These are some of my favorite projects I have worked on:
1. ClassChat is a work-in-progress application that will utilize my full-stack development skills with deep learning on the mission to empower students in seminar-style settings by leveraging AI to build confidence and encourage participation, helping them find their voice in both academic discussions and beyond.
2. hoop-easy-material-ui is a full stack react app that aims to help people find and create pickup basketball games. It is my most complete application and is hosted at hoopeasy.org. It is also the newest version of hoop easy that remodeled the UI and logic used to drive efficiency in the memory usage. The README file has lots of information on what changed from the old version of hoop easy and why it is actually better now than before. 
3. hoop-easy is similar to hoop-easy-material-ui but it is the original version of hoop-easy. I kept both the new version and the old one so that someone would be able to see what has changed both in UI development as well as changes to the overall logic. Hoop Easy was my largest project to this date, and it took a lot of time and creativity to re-create it nearly from scratch.
4. pmcslarrow@github.io is just my personal portfolio, but thought it best to be pinned.
